# Command & Conquer Renegade

An early fork of the open-source release of Renegade.

Currently focusing just on getting it building under a recent version of Visual C++,
using the Meson build system (you should be able to get this to give you VS projects).

Dependencies are currently completely mocked out it MockedSdks/ dir, so even if you get
this running you wont see much happening right now!
